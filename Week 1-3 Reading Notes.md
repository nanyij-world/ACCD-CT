# Week 1-3 Reading Notes
## Week1 Reading
###### Rune Madsen, Programming Design Systems
> Quote1: " Digital products are displayed on screens of different sizes and with dynamic content. Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation. Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages."

This quote reminds me of the importancfe of design in flexible format such as coding in order to keep the outfput to be able to suite different occassions in th digital age. Also, it sounds like making design digital helps it live longer. Then the question comes: when keeping design digital makes them easier to store and become malleable to different needs, how do the value and surprises from physical design keeping lost in this process?

> Quote2: "Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process. "

I really resonate with this way of thinking design due to my background in economics and math instead of a desing/art background. I was thinking to solve problems in functions instead of one point. It allows me to code easire, but I do think the other way around offers new angles to design. Flexiblly using these two different methods can be helpful and inspring.

> Quote3: " Software can be written to allow a range of possible outputs, and variations of a design system can be generated in (literally) fractions of a second. "

This thought inspired to think to use programming in design to make more customizable future possible, for both digital and physical products. Via programming and setting variables, customers can have more personal touch in choosing their products.

## Week2 Reading
###### Chapter 7 "Unfortunate Shortcuts" from Janelle Shane, You Look Like a Thing and I Love You
> Quote1: "This is another example of overfitting, since the AIs would be surprised to find that their tricks only work in their simulations, not in the real world....Remember that it’s really hard to make a simulation detailed enough to allow a machine learning algorithm’s strategies to work both in the simulation and in real life."

As AI and machine learning is dependent on the data input and what defined by the engineer or designer that create it, the outcome of Ai can be controversial due to overdrafting.  This quote inspired a series of questions: is it even possible to really capture all the features and data of the real world? Is there a single answer/reaction to questions even in real world? If not, how should AI react to that?

> Quote2: "When using AIs to solve real-world problems, we also need to take a close look at what is being predicted. There’s a kind of algorithm called predictive policing, which looks at past police records and tries to predict where and when crimes will be recorded in the future."

As the data input to AI is always relatively "past", it brings a past of human society into the algorithm, together with the existing biases and social problems like gender and race stereotypes. Thus, how to use AI in a positively way to predict a future society? Should components like diminishing steretypical behaviors to be counted into the algorithms? Who decide what is the input into the algorithm then?

> Quote3: "It’s a bit like checking the work of a colleague—a very, very strange colleague. ... AI is like a human brain and some ways in which it’s very different. "

As the name suggests, humans are always expecting artificial intelligence to be like human. However, the question is should it be like human? Is it good or bad for it to act/speack like a human? I can imagine a scene at work place where human and AI are colleagues, but it will be so hard for humans to tell if the colleague is human or AI.

## Week3 Reading
###### Joyce Carol Oates, Notes on Failure, AI Ethics Case studies
> Quote1: "The artist, perhaps more than most people, inhabits failure, degree of failure and accommodation and compromise."

I am not surpirsed to hear from many people that artists bear less of a responsibiliy and thus can have more space and time to test success or access failure. The notion of failure is always linked to higher cost and more time imput. Though art is less possible to be planned, to be predicted and thus always to execute with success with small number of attempts.  

> Quote2: "Isn't there, perhaps, a very literael advantage, now and then, to failure? - a way of turning even the most melancholy of experiences inside-out, until they resemble experiences of value, or growth, of profound significance?"

This question actually reminds me of code debugging and how a computer program can become success. The process of writing code is never without failure and testing of any failure. The goal is more to the end of "no error" in stead of "success". 

> Quote3: "But the genius cannot know that he is a genius - not really: he has hapes, he has premonitions, he suffers raging paranoid doubts, but he can have, in the end, only himself for measurement. Susccess is distanct and illusory, failure one's loyal companion, one's stimulus for imagining that the next book will be beteer..."

The idea of genius is always relative. Is there one person that is an absolute genius or who success in everything? How to measure that and who should be deciding? The subjectivity of idea of ""genius" and "success" that make the idea of failure more ambivalent. Though, I agree with the author that failure can become stimulus. However, can't success?
